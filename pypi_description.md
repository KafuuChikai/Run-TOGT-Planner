# Run-TOGT-Planner

This Python package provides an interface to run the [**Time-Optimal Gate-Traversing (TOGT) Planner**](https://github.com/FSC-Lab/TOGT-Planner), originally a C++ project.

With this package, you can generate random racetracks and plan paths using the **TOGT Planner**. It supports looping to generate a large number of high-quality trajectories that prioritize dynamic feasibility.
